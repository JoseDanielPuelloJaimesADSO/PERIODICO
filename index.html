                <br> son: “Gotta walk the district.”<br>
                Ehrhardt and her opponent,
                Republican Earnest Leonard, have been
                ounding the pavement to introduce
                themselves to voters in a re-drawn
                District 107, which includes the north-
                ern half of Oak Lawn, sections of cen-
                tral and east Dallas, and a northern
                swath east of central expressway jutting
                up to the LBJ Freeway. <br>
                Ehrhardt has picked up the endorse-
                ment of the political action committee
                of Lesbian/Gay Political Coalition of
                Dallas. Leonard received the endorse-
                ment of Log Cabin Republicans of
                Dallas. <br>
                The candidates´ get-out-the-vote
                efforts are kicking into gear for
                election day. With statistics and maps of
                every square inch of the district, it
                seems, Ehrhardt plans to have an army
                of about 30 “poll pushers” at votin;
                sites handing out pro-Ehrhardt litera-
                ture, in addition to running a phone
                bank to remind people to vote and
                coordinate transportation to the polls. <br>
                
                Ehrhardt said suprise its the most
                common response she gets when
                knocking on doors. Most people say
                they have never met their representa-
                tive in the Texas Legislature before, a
                situation which she said she finds frus-
                trating, given her efforts to get out in
                the district. <br>
                Gay and lesbian issues will almost
                certainly be featured in the 1997 legisla-
                tive session. The Lesbian/Gay Rights
                Lobby of Texas plans to offer several
                proposals, as el as to fight off expect-
                ed anti-gay bills:
                <ul class="lis_tex">
                    <li >Hate crimes. Both candidates for
                        District 107 have pledged to support a
                        hate crimes bill, which would stiffen
                        criminal penalties for crimes motivated
                        by religious, racial, or anti-gay preju-
                        dice. Leonard said he generally sup-
                        ports anti-crime measures. Ehrhardt is
                        widely credited with being a leader in
                        last session’s attempt to pass a revised
                        hate crimes bill, which narrowly failed
                        in the House.</li>  
                    <li> Employment Non-Discrimination.
                        Leonard opposes a gay civil rights bill
                        to outlaw job discrimination against
                        gays and lesbians, saying such mea-
                        sures inevitably lead to “frivolous law-
                        suits,” but he has pledged a policy of</li>
                   </ul>
                
        </div>
        <div class="caja5">
            
            <ul class="lis_tex2">
                non-discrimination for his own staff.
Ehrhardt supports the civil rights bill,
arguing that employment security is
one of the most important social justice
questions faacing the community.
Observers say such a bill has no chance
of passing during the Texas
Legislature´s next session.
<li>Same-gender marriage. Leonard
    has said he would vote for a bill ban-
    ning same-gender marriage in Texas.
    He said he sees no need to expand the
    family code to provide state recognition
    for same-gender unions. Ehrhardt
    opposes the measure, which is expected
    to be introduced by anti-gay conserva-
    tives.Analysts expect a marriage bill
    forbidding same-gender unions to pass
    during the next legislative session. The
    question, they say, is how much anti-
    gay language will be included in the
    measure.</li>
    <li>AIDS funding. Both candidates
        have said they support increased fund-
        ing for the AIDS Drug Assistance
        Program, which provides HIV medica-
        tions to low-income Texans, although
        Leonard stipulated that he would need
        to be convinced that the money was
        helping Pople is et “feeding the
        advances, i “the protease
        inhibitors, have wildly escalated treat-
        ment costs and lobbyists say an addi-
        tional $14 million will be needed from
        the state to fully fund the Texas pro-
        gram. <br>
        Given Ehrhardt’s long history of
        involvement for gay and lesbian issues,
        many Democratic activists have
        expressed shock that the Log Cabin
        Republicans-Dallas have backed
        Leonard, endorsing the GOP candidate,
        hosting a fundraiser-reception for him
        and providing campaign volunteers. <br>
        They [Log Cabin] really need to
        examine what their motivations are,”
        said Peter Brooks, co-chair of the LGRL
        board. “If the Republicans control [the
        Texas House or Senate], we can kiss
        goodbye trying to get anything
        through." <br>
        Brooks said Ehrhardt had a 100 per-
        cent voting record for gay issues, and
        cited her assistance during the last ses-
        sion and her persistence in lobbying
        other legislators to support the hate
        crimes bill.</li>
